## Modifications for Mock API Integration

**Goal:** This project was modified by an AI agent to integrate a new mock API endpoint and update the application's functionality.

**Steps Performed:**

1.  **Cloned the original repository:** `https://github.com/Lz027/Integration-with-api---sesion-6-modified.git`
2.  **Installed Dependencies:** All project dependencies were installed using `npm install`.
3.  **API Integration:**
    *   A new mock API endpoint was provided: `https://6901ab8ab208b24affe33ab3.mockapi.io/api/v1/songs`
    *   The initial instructions included web-based JavaScript (`document.getElementById`) which is incompatible with React Native.
    *   The code was adapted to the React Native environment in `src/screens/SongListScreen.tsx`.
    *   The implementation now uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to fetch and manage the song data.
    *   A `FlatList` component is used to display the song data in a performant way.
4.  **Pushed to New Repository:** The final, modified project was pushed to this new repository.

## Modifications for Session 6

**Goal:** Implement a Bottom Tab Navigator to switch between the existing Movie List (Ghibli API) and a new Song List (OpenWhyd API).

**Implemented by:** Ahmed Masoud Baghni (20230040030)

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
